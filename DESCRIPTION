Description: A system for describing and manipulating the many models that are
    generated in causal inference and data analysis projects, as based on the
		causal theory and criteria of Austin Bradford Hill (1965) 
		<doi:10.1177/003591576505800503>. This system includes the addition of 
		formal attributes that modify base `R` objects, including terms and 
		formulas, with a focus on variable roles in the "do-calculus" of modeling,
		as described in Pearl (2010) <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1203>. For example, the 
		definition of exposure, outcome, and interaction are  implicit in the roles 
		variables take in a formula. These premises allow for a more fluent modeling
		approach focusing on variable relationships, and assessing effect 
		modification, as described by VanderWeele and Robins (2007) 
		<doi:10.1097/EDE.0b013e318127181b>. The essential goal is to help 
		contextualize formulas and models in causality-oriented workflows.
